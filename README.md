Caja Admin is a simple Python extension for the Caja file manager that
adds some administrative actions to the right-click menu:

*   **Open as Administrator**: opens a folder in a new Caja window running
    with administrator (root) privileges.
*   **Edit as Administrator**: opens a file in a Pluma window running with
    administrator (root) privileges.
*   **Run as Administrator**: runs an executable file with administrator (root)
    privileges inside a MATE Terminal.


## WARNING!

Running the File Manager, the Text Editor or an executable with Administrator
privileges **is dangerous**!
**You can easily destroy your system if you are not careful!**
**Think twice** before doing so, especially before running untrusted executables
downloaded from the Internet.
**They can contain malware**, which can do
**irreversible damage to your system** when given Administrator privileges!

You will be warned the first time you use one of the actions above.
